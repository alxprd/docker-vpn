# At any time, you can check the status of UFW with this command:
sudo ufw status
sudo ufw status verbose

# If you're using the rule number to delete firewall rules, the first thing you'll want to do is get a list of your firewall rules. The UFW status command has an option to display numbers next to each rule, as demonstrated here:
sudo ufw status numbered

# If we decide that we want to delete rule 2, the one that allows port 80 (HTTP) connections, we can specify it in a UFW delete command like this:
sudo ufw delete 2

# The alternative to rule numbers is to specify the actual rule to delete. For example, if you want to remove the allow http rule, you could write it like this:
sudo ufw delete allow http

# You could also specify the rule by allow 80, instead of by service name:
sudo ufw delete allow 80

# If you decide you don't want to use UFW, you can disable it with this command:
sudo ufw disable

# If you already have UFW rules configured but you decide that you want to start over, you can use the reset command:
sudo ufw reset
